<span class="first-letter">I</span> am an experienced junior front-end developer with extensive knowledge and experience in the latest, cutting edge client-side technologies.

I enjoy learning and experimenting with new JavaScript libraries and front end technologies.
Some of my most recent experiments have included technologies like [SVG](/skills/view?id=svg), [WebGl](/skills/view?id=threejs) and [React](/skills/view?id=react)
