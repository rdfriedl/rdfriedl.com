<span class="first-letter">A</span>bout five years ago I started programming with a program called <a href="http://www.yoyogames.com/" target="_blank">GameMaker</a>, which was a drag-and-drop game builder with a lot of cool features.
When I started using it, I was only programming with the draggable programming blocks, though after about 5 to 6 months, I found it easier to use the programming language that came with it.

**The programming language was called "GML"**, and for a programming language, it was very basic. No objects, no classes, and no functions aside from the GameMaker API functions.
I had also been experimenting with GameMakers basic 3D engine and managed to create some interesting games.
Unfortunately I never really finished any of them, though the knowledge and experience I gained from them was invaluable.

**After about two years of GameMaker**, I had learned almost everything there was to know about GameMaker and its scripting language "GML", so I decided to move on to something else.
The main reason I wanted to move on from GameMaker was that its scripting language (GML) was not advanced enough to build complex games.

**My dad introduced me to a programming language called "Adobe Flex"**, and I started learning that.
Though after about 2 months of playing with it, I was still having trouble grasping the concepts of modules and classes.
I guess that I just was not ready to learn those things at the time.

**Then I found HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.**
Which was perfect at the time, because I had been trying to build websites out of Flex and it was not working out so well, I guess Flex really was not designed for creating websites.
At first it seemed confusing, though after reading reading a few books and lot of the tutorials on [w3schools.com](http://www.w3schools.com/) it started to make since to me.
One of the first libraries I learned was [jQuery](/skills/view?id=jquery), which at the time I found very useful since I did not know the in-and-outs of the DOM.
I remember when I discovered the prototype chain in JavaScript, and the way object inherited properties from each other, I thought it was so cool.

**As I got deeper and deeper into JavaScript** I discovered libraries like [Knockout](/skills/view?id=knockout) and [Bootstrap](/skills/view?id=bootstrap).
which at the time seems like the greatest things ever, though I had no idea just how big the Front-end development community really was.
One of the things that really amazed me about JavaScript, was just how many libraries there were, all of then fixing different problems in their own way.

**It was about this time that I started doing contract work** on an application called [AdFactory](/work/view?id=adfactory) for a company called Wowspring.
While I did help design some of the interface, my main focus was on creating the drag-and-drop editor that would be the core of the application.
After about 8 months of development, the first version was ready for launch.
We had been heavily testing the application about a month in advance so the launch when smoothly with hardly any bugs.

**After AdFactory had launched** I started developing a video rendering solution for AdFactory that would allow users to render videos in the browser.
The idea was that it would create `.mp4` video files out of a list of image slides with transitions.
It was hard but at the same time rewarding, because in the process of building it I learned a lot about JavaScript and web development in general.
After about 2 - 3 months of developing and testing, it was finally ready to be launched.
AdFactory was the first online application to have a full video creating tool that ran in the users browser, other companies where using server-side technologies to render their videos.
