<span class="first-letter">A</span>bout five years I started programming with a program called <a href="http://www.yoyogames.com/" target="_blank">GameMaker</a>, which was a drag-and-drop game builder with a lot of cool features.
When I started using it, I was only programming with the draggable blocks, though after about 5 to 6 months, I found it easier to use the programming language that came with it.

It was called "GML", and for a programming language, it was very basic. No objects, no classes, and no functions aside from the GameMaker API functions.
I played with that for about two years or so, and in that time I managed to build a lot of games, though I never really finished any of them because I kept getting distracted by new ideas.
By the time I got bored of it, I had learned almost everything there was to know about GameMaker and its scripting language "GML".

I had also been experimenting with its basic 3D engine and managed to create some interesting games.

Unfortunately I never really finished any of them, though the knowledge and experience I gained from them was invaluable.
