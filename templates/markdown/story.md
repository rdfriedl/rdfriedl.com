<span class="first-letter">A</span>bout five years ago I started programming with a program called <a href="http://www.yoyogames.com/" target="_blank">GameMaker</a>, which was a drag-and-drop game builder with a lot of cool features.
When I started using it, I was only programming with the draggable blocks, though after about 5 to 6 months, I found it easier to use the programming language that came with it.

It was called "GML", and for a programming language, it was very basic. No objects, no classes, and no functions aside from the GameMaker API functions.
I played with that for about two years or so, and in that time I managed to build a lot of games, though I never really finished any of them because I kept getting distracted by new ideas.
By the time I got bored of it, I had learned almost everything there was to know about GameMaker and its scripting language "GML".

I had also been experimenting with its basic 3D engine and managed to create some interesting games.

Unfortunately I never really finished any of them, though the knowledge and experience I gained from them was invaluable.

### ---TODO---

After about two years of GameMaker i decided to move on to something else, mainly because i was getting board of it.
My dad introduced me to Adobe Flex
i never really got into it.
i could not wrap my head around the concepts of classes and modules.
i ended up building web sites out of it, which was not what it was designed for.

then after about 5 to 8 months after i started Flex, my uncle introduced me to JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
at first it seemed very confusing, though after about 2 months of reading books and documentations i started to get the hang of it.

one of the most awesome moments i remember, was when discovering the prototype chain in JavaScript, and the way object inherited properties from each other.
