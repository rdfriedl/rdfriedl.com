<span class="first-letter">A</span>bout five years ago I started programming with a program called <a href="http://www.yoyogames.com/" target="_blank">GameMaker</a>, which was a drag-and-drop game builder with a lot of cool features.
When I started using it, I was only programming with the draggable programming blocks, though after about 5 to 6 months, I found it easier to use the programming language that came with it.

It was called "GML", and for a programming language, it was very basic. No objects, no classes, and no functions aside from the GameMaker API functions.
I played with that for about two years or so, and in that time I managed to build a lot of games, though I never really finished any of them because I kept getting distracted by new ideas.

I had also been experimenting with GameMakers basic 3D engine and managed to create some interesting games.

Unfortunately I never really finished any of them, though the knowledge and experience I gained from them was invaluable.

After about two years of GameMaker, I had learned almost everything there was to know about GameMaker and its scripting language "GML", so i decided to move on to something else.
The main reason i wanted to move on from GameMaker was that its scripting language (GML) was not advanced enough to build complex games.

My dad introduced me to a programming language called "Adobe Flex", and i started learning that.
Though after about 2 months of playing with it, i was still having trouble grasping the concepts of modules and classes.
I guess that i just was not ready to learn those things at the time.

Then my uncle introduced me to HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
Which was perfect at the time, because i had been trying to build websites out of Flex and it was not working out so well, i guess Flex really was not designed for creating websites.

At first it seemed confusing, though after reading reading a few books and lot of the tutorials on [w3schools.com](http://www.w3schools.com/) it started to make since to me.
One of the first libraries i learned was [jQuery](/skills/view?id=jquery), which at the time i found very useful since i did not know the in-and-outs of the DOM.
I remember when i discovered the prototype chain in JavaScript, and the way object inherited properties from each other, i thought it was so cool.

As i got deeper and deeper into JavaScript i discovered libraries like [Knockout](/skills/view?id=knockout) and [Bootstrap](/skills/view?id=bootstrap), which at the time seems like the greatest things ever.
It was about this time that i started doing contract work on an application called [AdFactory](/work/view?id=adfactory) for a company called Wowspring.
I learned a lot about JavaScript and web development in general while i was working on AdFactory.
